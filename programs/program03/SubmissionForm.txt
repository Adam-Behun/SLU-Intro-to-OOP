Brief overview of program, including any known bugs:
	At first, this program keeps a variable size which enables us to scale the whole picture into dimensions we choose (I could have also added that as an input that we would chose the size variable). 
	Then this program creates a board for the Backgammon game, starting with the background in the given colors, continuing with the triangles, and finishing with the checkers. I was using for loops as much as I could to reduce redundancy in my code, as some of the features of this picture repeat themselves. 
	I do not think that the program has any bugs, rather it would be a matter of desing (colors, borders, sizes) or code redundancy (I believe that there are many more ways to make this code more efficient).

Other comments or response program-specific questions:
I would be interested to see what the most efficient way to build this gameboard is.

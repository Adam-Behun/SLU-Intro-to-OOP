Brief overview of program, including any known bugs:
This program shows my ability to use cs1graphics module and time module to create a short animation including instances of distinct classes (Cirlce, Rectangle, Polygon, and others). In this program there are 6 distinct frames:

1. Background including sun, trees, and grass
2. Dog is added to the scene
3. Cat is added to the scene
4. Dog moves away from the scene
5. Cat moves away from the scene
6. Background including sun, trees, and grass

The smalltree layer (lines 35 - 45) is a special type of bush with a transparent trunk in a shape of a Rectangle 3*'Ha'

Other comments or response program-specific questions:
I did not find an easy way to clone the sunrays - rotations and moving were too confusing. I also checked the book but they created new sunrays as different instances of a Path class as well. Would you suggest to clone them or create them as new ones? Is it that big of a difference in the length of the code or it does not really matter? I would like to learn how many lines is too much for a project like this, basically.

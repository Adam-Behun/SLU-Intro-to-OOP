Brief overview of program, including any known bugs:
This program first takes 2 inputs from the user, an original sequence of a DNA and a pattern which is found in the original sequence first as a original and then as a reversed version, this program then creates a mutation of this whole original DNA sequence.

This works in a few steps: 

1. Function which makes a reversed version of an pattern input
2. Split method which breaks down the inputed DNA sequence into two parts
3. Split method which breaks down the leftover sequence
4. Reversing the identified middle part of a DNA sequence -> middle part is between pattern and reversed pattern
5. Printing individual requirements

Other comments or response program-specific questions:
I am wondering whether there is a bug in the program that would show that for some instances it is not working.

1. In-line comments
   I think that it would be usefull to add in-line comments to the code as it helps with the explanation of what the code is supposed to do. Even though the code is fairly short, I think it is a good practice to ensure clarity and readability.

2. Docstrings
   As I saw in the example you provided for us as how this code could be done (Michael Goldwasser solution), I think it is a good idea to add docstrings, again to ensure that we all uderstand what this program is supposed to do. 

3. It would be easier to create the function def pluralNoun(word) if we would have the function, _generallyAddS. With that function we would be able to make the consequent ones more concise and aslo readable.
